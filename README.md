# ESS2021-2X-Intro-to-R

This is a repository for the class files I used in teaching the class 2X Introduction to R in the 2021 Essex Summer School's second session. The materials are heavily based on the 1X class of the same year taught by [Lorenzo Crippa](https://lorenzo-crippa.github.io/).

The class covers the basics of getting started in R, including using scripts, using RStudio, using R projects to set the file path for a project, data types, R's data structures, importing data, managing datasets with dplyr, and some basic statistical tests and models.
